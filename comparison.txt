The reason that the original piano scale (scale.wav) and our synthesized sine scale (sin_scale.wav) sound different is because they do not have the same timbre. In other words, they do not have the same harmonic content. The piano scale contains many more harmonics (which are all multiplied by a combination of scalars) that yields a richer and more realistic tone. However, the synthesized sine wave only produces a single tone at the given frequency, which is created by stripping down each note of the original scale to only its fundamental frequency. The synthesized note does not contain the same harmonics as the piano note. This is also corroborated by the time-aligned spectrograms of both .wav files. There is only a single frequency for the duration of the scale for the synthesized .wav; however, there are more frequencies present for each note of the original piano scale. We can conclude that the differing harmonic content of both audio files is the reason they sound so different despite playing the same pitches at the same time.
